        <h1>Moving Mina Forward — An Invitation</h1>
        <hr />
        <div
          class="in-content"

          <p>
            Mina’s succinct blockchain architecture means Mina stays accessible,
            decentralized, and sustainable over time — and opens up exciting
            opportunities to build a secure, democratic, user-centered future
            that connects crypto and the real world. On the architecture side,
            we’re exploring how to fulfill Mina’s potential as an open beacon of
            truth that’s accessible from any location and any device — from
            browsers to phones to smart homes, and for any user no matter where
            they are around the world.
          </p>

        <div class="in-content" data-tag="Mina" personal-tag="DeFiExpansion">
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the Foundation will focus on Mina’s technical
            architecture, growing the ecosystem and partnerships, and on serving
            the community. The marketing, community, legal teams, and I will now
            channel our passion through the Foundation. I will be becoming the
            Mina Foundation’s CEO to lead our efforts under this new umbrella.
            We believe not just in the power of our technology, but in the power
            of our community. Our intention is to develop systems and structures
            for increasing self-organization — empowering the community to grow
            and scale, and putting the people using the protocol at the center
            of how decisions are made and resources are allocated.
